# Contribution Guide

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of our development process, guidelines, and steps required to contribute to the project.

## Work Streams

Bamboo development is divided across several streams of work with the goal of separating concerns and facilitating rapid development. 

Each stream is owned by a Bamboo core team member who oversees and directs all development within that stream. As a contributor, you will be communicate with the owner of the stream in which you were assigned.

Stream owners will assign tasks to contributors and ensure that all TODOs are tracked.
