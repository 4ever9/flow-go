## Documentation instructions for stream owners

Stream owners are responsible for ensuring that all code owned by their stream is well-documented. Documentation for a stream should accomplish the following:

1. Provide an overview of all stream functions
2. Outline the different packages used by the stream
3. Highlight dependencies on other streams

Each stream has a top-level documentation page in the [/docs/streams](streams) folder. This page, which acts as a jumping-off point for new contributors, should list each function of the stream along with a short description and links to its relevant packages.

Here's an example: [docs/streams/pre-execution.md](streams/pre-execution.md)

### Stream package documentation 

All packages owned by a stream should be documented using `godoc`.

Here's an example: [internal/clusters](/internal/clusters)

**Auto-generated READMEs**

A `README.md` can be generated from the `godoc` output by updating [godoc.sh](/godoc.sh) with the path of your package. The above example was generated by this line:

```bash
godoc2md github.com/dapperlabs/bamboo-node/internal/clusters > internal/clusters/README.md
```

Once your package is added to that file, running `go generate` in the root of this repo will generate a new `README.md`.
