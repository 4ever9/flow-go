# Pre-Execution

The pre-execution stream concerns all aspects of the transaction flow from the moment a transaction is submitted to the network until it enters the consensus flow. 

More specifically, pre-execution covers the following:

- Transaction submissions from user agents
- Transaction routing
- Cluster formation
- Collection building, consensus and signing
- Publishing collections to security nodes
- Transaction and collection storage
- Responding to user agent queries

All pre-execution duties are performed by access nodes.

## Terminology

* **Access Node (AN)** - The user-facing node archetype
* **Transaction** - A user-submitted request to execute code on the blockchain
* **Node Stake** - The amount a node has staked on its reputation within the network
* **Epoch** - A fixed period of time (measured in blocks) during which node stakes are fixed
* **AN Cluster** - A grouping of ANs that work together to form collections
* **Collection** - A set of transactions bundled together for execution
