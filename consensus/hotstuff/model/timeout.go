// TimerInfo represents a local timeout for a view, and indicates the Pacemaker has not yet
// observed evidence to transition to the next view (QC or TC). When a timeout occurs for
// the first time in a view, we will broadcast a TimeoutObject and continue waiting for evidence
// to enter the next view, but we will no longer submit a vote for this view. A timeout may occur
// multiple times for the same round (indicated by Tick > 0), which is an indication
// to re-broadcast our TimeoutObject for the view, to ensure liveness.
